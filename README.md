## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, caring for our elderly parents, especially those battling dementia, has become one of the most challenging responsibilities we face. The heart-wrenching reality is that many of us struggle to provide the constant care and attention our loved ones need while juggling work, family, and other life commitments. The guilt of not being there enough, the worry about their safety, and the helplessness of watching them struggle with daily tasks can be overwhelming.

**MindTrace** was born from this very human struggle. We understand that every family dealing with dementia faces unique challenges - the fear of leaving a parent alone, the difficulty in tracking their daily activities, and the constant worry about their well-being. Our solution brings together cutting-edge AI technology with deep empathy for the human experience.

At its core, MindTrace is more than just an app - it's a digital companion that never sleeps, never gets tired, and never forgets. It's the gentle voice that reminds your mother to take her medication, the patient listener who engages your father in meaningful conversations, and the vigilant guardian that captures important moments from their day. But most importantly, it's the bridge that connects you to your loved one's world, even when you can't be physically present.

We believe that technology should serve humanity, not replace it. That's why MindTrace is designed to work seamlessly with your existing care network - whether it's a trusted family member, a professional caregiver, or a dedicated maid. Our multi-layered security ensures that your loved one's privacy and dignity are always protected, while our intelligent notification system keeps everyone who cares informed and connected.

In a world where dementia can make communication difficult and memories fade, MindTrace helps preserve the precious moments, maintain routines, and ensure that no important detail is lost. It's our way of saying that even in the face of cognitive challenges, every life deserves to be lived with dignity, connection, and love.

### CI/CD Pipeline

## Challenges & Solutions

### üîÑ Chat Memory Scalability Challenge
**Problem**: The default Spring AI chat memory implementation was either in-memory (hindering horizontal scaling) or database-based (too slow for real-time conversations).

**Solution**: We implemented a custom Redis-based chat memory system that provides both high performance and horizontal scalability, ensuring smooth conversational experiences across multiple server instances.

### üìö Spring AI Learning Curve
**Problem**: Spring AI was released this year with limited external resources and documentation. Most LLM-generated code examples were deprecated or outdated.

**Solution**: We thoroughly studied the official Spring AI documentation and followed best practices to ensure our implementation was up-to-date and production-ready, despite the lack of community resources.

### üñ•Ô∏è First-Time VM Deployment
**Problem**: This was our first virtual machine deployment, requiring careful consideration of security aspects like SSH key protection and ensuring reproducible infrastructure.

**Solution**: We implemented comprehensive security measures including SSH key protection and used Ansible for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure our VM setup is reproducible and maintainable.

### üîí Security & Privacy Implementation
**Problem**: Ensuring robust security and privacy for sensitive healthcare data while maintaining usability for elderly users and their caregivers.

**Solution**: We implemented a multi-layered security approach:
- **OTP-based verification** for caregiver management
- **Secret-based QR codes** with short-lived tokens for secure patient registration
- **Telegram integration** with secure UUIDs for notifications
- **Distroless Docker images** to minimize attack surface
- **Minimal attack surface** through careful design of authentication and authorization flows
