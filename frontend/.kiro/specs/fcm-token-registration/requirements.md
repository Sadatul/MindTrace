# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) token registration and management for push notifications in the dementia care app. The system needs to register device FCM tokens with the backend API to enable push notifications, handle token updates when they change, and ensure tokens are properly synchronized during user authentication flows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my device to automatically register for push notifications when I log in, so that I can receive important notifications from the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL send the current FCM token to the backend API
2. WHEN a user completes registration and logs in THEN the system SHALL register the FCM token with the backend
3. WHEN the FCM token registration fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but not block the user flow
4. WHEN sending the FCM token THEN the system SHALL include a unique device ID that persists across app sessions
5. WHEN sending the FCM token THEN the system SHALL include a human-readable device name

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my device to stay registered for notifications even when the FCM token changes, so that I continue receiving notifications without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FCM token is refreshed by Firebase THEN the system SHALL automatically update the token in the backend
2. WHEN the token update API call fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation
3. WHEN updating the FCM token THEN the system SHALL use the same device ID as the original registration
4. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL skip token updates until next login

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the device registration to use consistent device identification, so that the backend can properly manage device-specific notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is first installed THEN the system SHALL generate a unique device ID
2. WHEN the app is launched on subsequent sessions THEN the system SHALL use the same device ID
3. WHEN the app is uninstalled and reinstalled THEN the system SHALL generate a new device ID
4. WHEN generating device names THEN the system SHALL create human-readable names based on device information
5. WHEN device information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use a fallback naming scheme

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for FCM token operations, so that I can troubleshoot notification issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FCM token operations succeed THEN the system SHALL log success messages
2. WHEN FCM token operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN network errors occur during registration THEN the system SHALL log the specific error type
4. WHEN authentication fails during token registration THEN the system SHALL log the authentication error
5. WHEN the backend API returns errors THEN the system SHALL log the response details
